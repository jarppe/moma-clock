# moma-clock

Inspired by [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/INEEEEDIT/comments/6z3455/a_clock_clock/)
I got curious how to implement something like that in sw.

More links to the actual thing:

This is an attempt to implement something similar in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org)

By following the links to (MoMa store)[https://store.moma.org/home/clocks/clock-clock-24/119937-119937.html]
I assumed that this is an art piece in MoMa, hence the name of the project.
